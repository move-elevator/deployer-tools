> The Deployer Tools combine multiple [deployer](https://deployer.org/) recipes for an improved deployment process and workflow.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Feature Branch Deployment](#feature-branch-deployment)
- [Symfony](#symfony)
- [TYPO3](#typo3)
- [Standalone Tasks](#standalone-tasks)

## ‚ú® Features

The focus relies on reusable concluded tasks and the possibility to combine multiple deployment workflows, e.g. [Symfony](#symfony) and [Feature Branch Deployment](#feature-branch-deployment).

- predefined **deployment workflows** for *TYPO3* and *Symfony* applications
- compact **feature branch deployment**
- useful **standalone tasks** for extending existing workflows
